    </div>

    <div class="package-details">
      <p>
        BHAKTAPUR DURBAR SQUARE (UNESCO World Heritage Site): Bhaktapur Durbar Square is an elegant and open space
        facing south surrounded by buildings dating from the 13th century to the 18th century. The 15th century Palace
        of 55 Carved Windows called Pachpanna Jhyale Durbar and the palace entrance, the Golden Gate - a masterpiece in
        repoussé art, have added splendor to this palace square. The extraordinary Durbar Square with its extraordinary
        monuments reflects the glory days of the Malla dynasty when art and architecture thrived in the three cities of
        the valley.
        <br>

        In front of the palace, building are innumerable temples and architectural showpieces like the Lion Gate, the
        statue of King Bhupatindra Malla mounted on a giant stone pillar and the Batsala Temple. The stone temple of
        Batsala Devi is full of intricate carvings and is a beautiful example of Shikhara-style architecture. There is a
        bronze bell on the terrace of the temple, which is also known as the Bell of Barking Dogs. Erected by King
        Ranjit Malla in 1737, its sounding announced the beginning and end of a daily curfew.
        <br>

        NYATAPOLA TEMPLE: The unique temple of Bhaktapur, the Nyatapola literally means ‘five storied’ and rises above
        the city’s landscape as a remarkable landmark. It also has the distinction of having withstood the devastating
        earthquake of 1933. Dedicated to a Tantric goddess, the steps leading up to the temple are flanked by stone
        sculptures of deities and mythical beasts, each 10 times more powerful than the one immediately below.
        <br>
        BHAIRAVNATH TEMPLE: Dedicated to Bhairav, the God of Terror, the three-storied temple of Bhairavnath has only
        the head of Bhairav in the inner sanctum. Legend has it that the Bhairav’s head was cut off by a Tantric expert
        in order to keep him in Bhaktapur. Built-in pagoda style, the temple is noted for its artistic grandeur and
        stands adjacent to the famous five-storied Nyatapola Temple.
        <br>

        DATTATREYA SQUARE takes its name from the Dattatreya Temple dedicated to a three-headed combination of the Hindu
        deities Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. This temple is said to have been built from the trunk of a single tree. Near
        this temple is a monastery with exquisitely carved peacock windows.
        <br>

        SIDDHA POKHARI: For a small city, Bhaktapur has the largest number of public water tanks built within the city
        limits. Siddha Pokhari, which dates back to the Lichhavi period, is situated at the bus stop. This large
        rectangular pond teems with fish and has stone images of different Hindu and Buddhist deities on the walls
        surrounding it.
        <br>

        THIMI is a Newar town situated about 8 km east of Kathmandu on the way to Bhaktapur. Besides farming, most of
        the households here are engaged in pottery. This laid-back town not only supplies Kathmandu its pottery but also
        its vegetables. The two important deities here are those of Balkumari Temple, dedicated to the Mother Goddess,
        and Karunamaya, the Buddha of Compassion.
        <br>

        SURYA BINAYAK: The temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Ganesh. Situated in a thick forest to the south of
        Bhaktapur, it is a 20-minute walk from the bus stop. The temple is crowded with devotees especially on Tuesdays
        and Saturdays.

        <br>

        CHANGU NARAYAN TEMPLE (World Heritage Monument): It is situated on a ridge overlooking Bhaktapur, about 12 km to
        the east of Kathmandu. Dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, it is one of the oldest specimens of pagoda
        architecture in the valley. The temple dating from the Licchavi period is embellished with exquisite wood and
        stone carvings.
