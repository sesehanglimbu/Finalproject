      <p>
        Patan Durbar Square is a significant tourist attraction in Nepal, situated in the ancient city of Patan, also
        known as Lalitpur, just south of Kathmandu.<br>

        The square holds historical and cultural importance as the former royal palace of the Malla kings who ruled the
        Patan kingdom during medieval times. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and showcases a blend of Newari and
        Hindu architectural styles.<br>

        The complex is adorned with intricately carved wooden windows, traditional pagoda-style temples, statues, and
        ancient palaces, offering visitors a glimpse into Nepal's rich craftsmanship.<br>

        Key structures in the square include the Patan Museum, Hiranya Varna Mahavihar (Golden Temple), Mahabouddha
        Temple, Krishna Temple, and Taleju Bell.<br>

        Patan Museum is a must-visit, housing an extensive collection of art, artifacts, and historical objects
        representing Nepal's cultural heritage.<br>

        Visitors can witness local artisans creating metalwork, woodcarvings, and intricate Thanka paintings, as Patan
        is renowned for its traditional arts and handicrafts.<br>

        The square remains an active religious site, and tourists might have the opportunity to witness various
        religious ceremonies and festivals.<br>
        

        There are several cafes and restaurants around Patan Durbar Square where visitors can enjoy local cuisine, as
        well as souvenir shops offering traditional handicrafts and mementos.<br>

        Guided tours and cultural heritage walks are available, providing insights into the history, culture, and
        architecture of the area.<br>

        Visitors are required to pay an entrance fee, which contributes to the maintenance and preservation of this
        historical site.<br>

        Please note that the information provided is based on my last update in September 2021, and it's advisable to
        verify any changes in entrance fees, timings, or other details before planning your visit.<br>
