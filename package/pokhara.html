        tranquil and picturesque setting that attracts travelers from all over the world.
        <br>
        One of the main attractions of Pokhara is Phewa Lake, a serene body of water that reflects the snow-capped peaks
        of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri mountain ranges. Visitors can take peaceful boat rides on the lake, enjoying the
        mesmerizing views and colorful sunsets that paint the sky.
       <br>
        For adventure seekers, Pokhara is an ideal destination for paragliding. The city's Sarangkot viewpoint is
        renowned for offering thrilling paragliding experiences, giving adventurers a bird's-eye view of the majestic
        mountains and the sprawling valley below.
       <br>
        The Annapurna region, which is easily accessible from Pokhara, offers some of the world's best trekking
        opportunities. Trekkers can embark on epic journeys like the Annapurna Base Camp Trek or the Ghorepani Poon Hill
        Trek, exploring rugged terrains, charming villages, and diverse landscapes along the way.
        <br>
        Pokhara also houses the World Peace Pagoda, an iconic structure symbolizing peace and harmony. The pagoda's
        hilltop location provides panoramic vistas of the city and the surrounding Himalayan peaks.
       <br>
        Visitors can witness the fascinating Davis Falls, where the water cascades into an underground tunnel, creating
        an awe-inspiring spectacle. Nearby, the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave awaits exploration, offering a chance to
        discover an underground cave with a sacred Hindu temple inside.
        <br>
        The International Mountain Museum is another noteworthy attraction in Pokhara, providing valuable insights into
        the history, culture, and mountaineering achievements of the Himalayan region.
        <br>
        Tourists can immerse themselves in the vibrant Tibetan culture at the Tibetan Refugee Camp, which not only
        educates visitors about the Tibetan way of life but also offers opportunities to purchase traditional
        handicrafts made by the Tibetan refugees.
        <br>
        Pokhara's appeal lies in its ability to cater to a diverse range of interests, whether it's seeking tranquility
        by the lake, pursuing thrilling adventures, or delving into the rich cultural heritage of the region. With its
