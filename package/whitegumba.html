        White Gumba, also known as Seto Gumba or Druk Amitabh Mountain, is a popular tourist destination in Nepal. It is
        a Buddhist monastery located on a hilltop in the outskirts of Kathmandu, about 8 kilometers northwest of the
        city center.<br>

        The monastery follows the Vajrayana tradition of Buddhism and is known for its impressive architecture, with a
        large white stupa as its main attraction. The serene and peaceful atmosphere of White Gumba makes it an ideal
        place for meditation and spiritual retreats.<br>

        Visitors come to White Gumba to enjoy the stunning views of the sunrise and sunset over the Kathmandu Valley.
        The hilltop location also provides an opportunity for trekking and hiking, allowing visitors to experience the
        natural beauty of the surrounding hills.<br>

        White Gumba holds religious significance and is a place of worship and pilgrimage for Buddhists from Nepal and
        around the world. As it is a religious site, visitors are expected to dress modestly and respectfully.<br>

        The picturesque setting and beautiful architecture of White Gumba make it a favorite spot for photography
        enthusiasts. The panoramic views of the Kathmandu Valley from the hilltop are particularly impressive.<br>

        For the most current information, including entry fees, accessibility, and any changes that might have occurred
        since my last update in September 2021, it's advisable to check with local authorities or travel agencies before
        planning your visit to White Gumba in Nepal.<br>
